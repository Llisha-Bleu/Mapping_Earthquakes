# Mapping_Earthquakes
New project on Mapping_Earthquakes analysis. Adjusting the current web app.

## Project Overview
Working with Diaster Reporting Network to create data visualizations to view earthquake data in relation to the tectonic platesâ€™ location on the earth. They would like to see all the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 on the map, and they would like to see the data on a third map. Ergo, this assignment consists of three technical deliverables. They are:

- Deliverable 1: Add Tectonic Plate Data
- Deliverable 2: Add Major Earthquake Data
- Deliverable 3: Add an Additional Map

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to visually show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days.


## Resources
- **Data Source:** `tectonic_plate_starter_logic.js`, `major_eq_starter_logic.js`, `index.html`,
- **Software:** `VS Code`, `Web Browser`, `Command-line interface`, `GitHub`
